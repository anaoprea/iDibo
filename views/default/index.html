        <p>
        An online voting system that allows users to cast their votes for an election or
        poll, without their individual opinion being made known to others. This service
        can be used for election purposes or different forms of polling.

        The project is part of the <strong>"Learn IT, girl" </strong> initiative aiming is to help women
        learn a programming language while doing an awesome project.

        The name iDibo is inspired from the Yoruba translation of voting which is idibo
        (ee--dee--bo) and the "i" in most internet-based project names - that's why it's
        pronounced as (ai-dee-boo) instead.</p>
